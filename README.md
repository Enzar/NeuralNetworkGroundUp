# NeuralNetworkGroundUp
Code for a basic neural network that is trained using the backpropogation algorithm. 
In order to demonstrate the code, I have added the java files NeuralXOR and NeuralTest. 
NeuralXOR demonstrates how a neural network is created and trained to approximate the XOR function.
NeuralTest demonstrates how a neural network can be trained to multiply and input by 2.
Console UI is not very practical, but allows uswers to play around with the neural networks to better understand them, 
and test different configurations of layers and neurons for different problems.
